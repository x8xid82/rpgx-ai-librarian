# 🧠 RPGX-AI Library (v1.3)

*A Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge System for the RPGX-AI Assistant Module*

---
 ### Developer Note: The current version of this module requires Ollama, qwen2.5:14b, and Node.js and the RAG server included with this distribution - In future updates we hope to support more platforms. Ollama and Node.js must be installed prior to creating RAG server. I've provided a RAG distribution to get it easily set up.

## Overview

**RPGX-AI Library** transforms RPGX-AI into a context-aware assistant for Game Masters and world-builders.  
It allows you to **ingest journals, notes, NPC sheets, and (soon) compendiums** into a locally running AI “knowledge base.”  
The AI can then answer questions, explain rules, summarize lore, or recall information directly from your game world.

Instead of relying solely on a language model’s generic memory, the module builds a searchable **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** database that references your own Foundry content.  
When you ask the AI something, it first retrieves the most relevant chunks of your uploaded documents, and then uses them to generate an answer—citing its sources.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**

   * The module sends the plain text of your Foundry journals (and soon other document types) to a lightweight local RAG server.
   * The server splits your text into manageable “chunks” and generates vector embeddings using **Ollama** and your chosen embedding model (e.g., `nomic-embed-text`).
   * These vectors are stored in `kb.json`, forming your knowledge base.

2. **Question-Answering**

   * When you query the AI, the RAG server compares your question’s embedding to all stored chunks.
   * The most relevant chunks are included as context in a prompt to your selected **local LLM** (e.g., `qwen2.5:14b`).
   * The AI then generates an answer using that context, citing the journal(s) it pulled from.

3. **Fallback Behavior**

   * If no relevant context is found, the system gracefully falls back to the model’s general knowledge base—ensuring consistent answers even when your RAG data doesn’t match.

## 🧩 Core Features

* 🗂️ **Journal Ingestion:** Add all or individual journals into your AI’s knowledge base.
* 🧾 **Full Text Parsing:** Automatically extracts text content from journal pages (HTML, Markdown, legacy).
* 🧹 **Knowledge Wipe:** Reset or clear the stored data from the RAG server.
* ⚙️ **Configurable Settings:**

  * **Chunk Size / Overlap** — Controls text segmentation granularity.
  * **RAG Top-K** — Number of chunks retrieved per query.
  * **Temperature / Max Tokens / Timeout** — AI generation settings for response creativity and performance.
  * **System Prompt (Persona)** — Define your AI’s tone and behavior.

* 💬 **Smart Citation:** AI cites which Foundry journals were used in its answer.
* 🧠 **Local \& Private:** All processing happens on your own machine—no external API or cloud dependencies.
* 🧩 **Extensible:** Future updates will add support for **Actors**, **Compendiums**, and custom ingest types.

## 🛠️ Installation Guide
Note: This RAG server is not compatible with AnythingLLM or other RAG APIs. It is specifically designed for the RPGX Librarian and RPGX Assistant modules.

### Step 1 — Install Ollama

1. Download from: [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. Run the following commands in terminal/powershell:

   ollama pull qwen2.5:14b
   ollama pull nomic-embed-text

### Step 2 — Install Node.js 18+

1. Download from: [Download RPGX RAG Distribution](https://www.patreon.com/file?h=143200618&m=570813685)


### Step 3 — Set Up the RAG Server

1. Download RPGX RAG distribution package: [https://www.patreon.com/file?h=143200618&m=570813685]
2. Unzip the file and place the unzipped "rpgx-rag-server" folder into the place you wish to host from.
3. Open the folder, right-click inside the folder and select: "Open Terminal"
4. Run this FIRST (required): "npm install" (only run this before first time setup of the RAG)
5. In the terminal, enter following command: "Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass" and hit Enter
6. Next, in the terminal, enter following command: ".\start-rag-server.ps1" and hit enter.
7. This should create and start your RPGX RAG server. (Keep terminal open)
8. To use make sure Ollama is running and that the module is configured in Foundry.
9. To start server on future sessions repeat steps 5 - 7.
